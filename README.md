# D.C. Resources
The following is a list of key District resources to help you with some of the needs and concerns you may have. This is not an exhaustive list, feel free to reach out to me at Santi4DC@gmail.com or on Twitter [@Santi4DC](https://twitter.com/Santi4DC) with questions or suggestions.


## [311](https://311.dc.gov/) ##

311 is a toll-free number that allows DC residents to request assistance with city services and information. This is the first place to go if you have a personal need (e.g. for a fire safety inspection or trash can) or request of a city agency (e.g. regarding a pothole or a rat infestation). The 311 call center is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can also place a request online, at 311.dc.gov or through the 311 app. I recommend you include a photo with your online submission and keep the tracking number.
